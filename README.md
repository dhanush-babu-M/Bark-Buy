## 🌟 Why This Project?

I chose this project because **e-commerce websites are common in the industry** and provide practical learning opportunities. Building an online pet store was simple, relatable, and allowed me to practice:

* **HTML** → for semantic structure
* **CSS** → for design & responsiveness
* **JavaScript** → for interactivity (validation & filtering)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Semantic structure (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
* **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries for responsive layouts
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, filtering

---

## 📌 Features

* 🧭 **Navigation bar** for browsing
* 🐕 **Product display grid** with filtering options (₹0–10, ₹0–50)
* 📝 **Contact form** with JavaScript validation
* ⭐ **Review/Feedback option**
* 📱 **Responsive design** (Flexbox + Grid + Media Queries)

---

## 🚀 Key Implementation Details

### 🔍 Price Filtering

* Each product has a **custom attribute** `data-price`:

  ```html
  <div class="product" data-price="25">Dog Food</div>
  ```
* In **JavaScript**, filtering is handled with:

  ```js
  document.querySelectorAll('.product').forEach(product => {
      const price = parseInt(product.getAttribute('data-price'));
      if (price <= selectedRange) {
          product.style.display = "block";
      } else {
          product.style.display = "none";
      }
  });
  ```

✅ This makes filtering **dynamic without page reload**.

### 📧 Contact Form Validation

* Added **event listeners** to check required fields.
* Validates:

  * **Email format** (regex)
  * **Name & message not empty**
* Shows error messages for invalid input → prevents incorrect submissions.

### 📱 Responsiveness

* Used **Flexbox & CSS Grid** for layouts.
* Applied **media queries** to adapt navigation, grids, and font sizes for mobile devices.

---

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

* Making the website **responsive across devices**.
* Implementing **JavaScript form validation** correctly.

Both challenges improved my **problem-solving skills** with layouts & DOM manipulation.

---

## 📈 Scalability & Improvements

* **Scalability** – If products grow into thousands:

  * Implement **pagination** or **lazy loading**
  * Fetch dynamically via **APIs**
  * Use **caching** for performance

* **Making it Industry-Ready**

  * Add a **backend** (Node.js / Java + MySQL)
  * Implement **authentication, cart & payment system**
  * Optimize frontend (minify CSS/JS, optimize images)
  * Ensure **security** (input sanitization) & **cross-browser support**

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Stronger grasp of **frontend fundamentals**
* Hands-on practice with **responsive design**
* Real-world use of **DOM manipulation & validation**
* Understanding how to **scale and improve** projects
